# newTabWebsite
 My personal link tree that opens with every new tab I open. This is my first HTML project, been using it since highschool, updating the links as needed. It's generally not the prettiest, but it works lol. The chrome extension I use, New Tab Redirect, can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna . In the options, "Always update tab, not redirect" is checked, "Sync this URL across browsers" is not.

 The clock also doesn't work when opened from a file, but works as expected when actually hosted as a website. https://haydenfuller.codehs.me/
